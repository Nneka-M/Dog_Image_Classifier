# Dog_Image_Classifier

## Project Overview
HappyTrails Veterinary Clinic aims to revolutionize online pet healthcare by enabling pet owners to upload images of their dogs for instant and accurate breed identification. This step is crucial as certain breeds are more susceptible to specific health conditions. Accurate breed classification will streamline the process of online medical diagnosis, reduce breed misidentification, and improve the customer experience.

This project utilizes three pre-trained image classifiers—VGG, ResNet, and AlexNet—to determine the most efficient and accurate approach for breed identification. The ultimate goal is to enhance customer satisfaction and increase the clinic's efficiency in diagnosing breed-specific conditions.

## Project Purpose and Goals
Purpose: Optimize HappyTrails' online diagnosis system by accurately identifying dog breeds.
### Key Goals:
- Accurate Breed Identification: Ensure breed identification is fast, accurate, and efficient.
- Reduce Breed Misidentification: Eliminate errors in breed classification to improve diagnosis precision.
- Improve Customer Experience: Offer an intuitive and seamless process for pet owners to receive an online diagnosis.

## Project Requirements
To achieve the project's goals, several key requirements must be met:

Classifier Accuracy: The model must correctly classify dog breeds, especially mixed breeds.
Robustness: The system must work with images of varying quality, backgrounds, and lighting conditions.
Efficiency: The classifier should have low latency, supporting a near-instant response time for users.
Scalability: The system should handle a large number of user uploads concurrently.

## Datasets and Sources
Dataset: The CNN has already learned the features from a giant dataset of 1.2 million images called ImageNet(opens in a new tab).

Images: JPEG files of dogs.
Labels: Breed names for each dog (e.g., Labrador, Golden Retriever).
